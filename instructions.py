Option 1 -> The square root curve will take the square root of each score and\
 multiply it by 10.

Option 2 -> The max score curve will see which grade range the top score\
 falls in between and subtract the max score from the upper number.

This modifier will be added to all grades.

Option 3 -> This will just add 10 points to all the scores

Note if you don't change the name of the csv import/ouput you won't have\
 the correct file names.
